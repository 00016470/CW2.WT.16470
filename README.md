# CW2.WT.16470
Event Planning app, created by using nodejs
Created app for planning events, user can write name of event, when and where this event will be. CRUD events were implemented, validation also implemented, so data with emty labels cannot be saved or updated. 

To run the application, in terminal we need to write 
1. npm init -y 
2. npm i express express-validator pug body-parser nodemon

So I wrote this app in nodejs in express framework, installed nodemon for running server constantly, installed pug because I wrote html pages in this framework
